#README

**WPF Gradient Editor** is a WPF application that enables you to preview and create linear gradient brushes for use in a WPF application.

##Easy Setup

This project uses only two binaries: **WpfGradientEditor.exe** and **Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.dll**. You just need to put them together in a folder.

The **Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.dll** referenced by **WPF Gradient Editor** is included in this project. It was built
from the source code provided by the [Extended WPF Toolkit™ Community Edition](http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/)
project. Nothing was changed in their source code. However, if you prefer, you may download the source code (or the binaries)
from the Extended WPF Toolkit™ Community Edition project and use those.

##Screenshots

This screenshot shows the editing of a linear gradient brush that has 9 gradient stops (or bands).
Some of the bands have been resized to be smaller or larger than the initial default.

This screenshot shows how the start and end point sliders have been adjusted to create a linear brush in another direction. 
Band dividers have been turned off in order to see the gradient better.
