#README

**WPF Gradient Editor** is a WPF application that enables you to preview and create linear gradient brushes for use in a WPF application.

##Easy Setup

This project uses only two binaries: **WpfGradientEditor.exe** and **Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.dll**. You just need to put them together in a folder.

The **Xceed.Wpf.Toolkit.dll** referenced by **WPF Gradient Editor** is included in this project. It was built
from the source code provided by the [Extended WPF Toolkit™ Community Edition](http://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/)
project. Nothing was changed in their source code. However, if you prefer, you may download the source code (or the binaries)
from the Extended WPF Toolkit™ Community Edition project and use those.
